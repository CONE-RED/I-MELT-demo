# I-MELT: Interactive Electric Arc Furnace AI Optimization Demo

## Solution Overview

**I-MELT** is an interactive demonstration system showcasing how AI can optimize electric arc furnace (EAF) operations in steel production. This web-based platform combines realistic steel industry data with physics-based simulation to create compelling demonstrations for steel industry executives, operators, and technical teams.

The system serves as a proof-of-concept for AI-driven steel production optimization, using sophisticated mock data and deterministic simulations to show real-world business value without requiring live furnace connections.

## How It Works

### Realistic Steel Production Simulation
- **Mock Heat Data**: Uses authentic steel industry datasets with real material compositions, chemistry values, and production parameters
- **Physics-Based Engine**: Deterministic simulation engine models actual furnace behavior (temperature, energy consumption, chemistry evolution)
- **Multi-Grade Steel Support**: Demonstrates different steel grades (13KhFA/9, 10G2B4, S235JR, 42CrMo4) with realistic material recipes and chemistry profiles
- **Historical Accuracy**: All data points based on real steel plant operations and industry standards

### AI-Powered Insights Engine
- **Deterministic AI Recommendations**: Context-aware insights tied to simulation state for consistent demo experiences
- **Crisis Scenario Management**: Controlled demonstration of critical situations (energy spikes, foam collapse, temperature risks) with AI-guided recovery
- **Process Optimization**: Shows energy reduction opportunities, chemistry adjustments, and timing optimizations based on furnace physics
- **Seeded Simulation**: Uses deterministic algorithms (seed=42) ensuring identical demo outcomes every time

### Professional Demo Interface
- **Executive-Ready Dashboard**: Clean, professional interface suitable for C-suite presentations
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket-driven updates create realistic operational feeling
