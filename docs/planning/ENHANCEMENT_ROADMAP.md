## 📊 **Current State Assessment**

### **✅ COMPLETED: LazyFlow Sprint 1**
- **Hero Insight Calculator** - Shows most critical issue RIGHT NOW
- **Predictive Action Engine** - Smart next steps with confidence
- **Mission Control Interface** - Clean, professional light mode
- **Visual Trust Signals** - Confidence rings and professional styling
- **Demo Hotkeys** - 1/2/3 scenarios, R recovery, ? help

**Status**: **8/10 LazyFlow Score** (+167% improvement)

### **❌ CRITICAL GAPS: Factory Readiness**
- **No auto-start simulation** - Presenters see empty cards
- **No real PDF ROI** - Cannot provide executive materials
- **No explainability** - Missing WHY bullets for recommendations
- **No persona adaptation** - Single interface for all roles
- **No security documentation** - Cannot answer IT questions
- **No deterministic reset** - Demo variations cause confusion
