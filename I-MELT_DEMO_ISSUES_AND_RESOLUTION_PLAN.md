## 🔴 Critical Issues Analysis

### **Issue #1: Non-Functional Interactive Elements**
**Current State:** Critical alerts and buttons do not respond to user interaction
- Clicking "Critical Action Required" produces no visible system response
- Manual start controls fail to trigger observable changes
- System appears frozen despite underlying functionality

**Business Impact:** 
- Demo appears broken during live presentations
- Executives lose confidence in technical competence
- Sales presentations fail at first impression

**Root Cause:** Event handlers not properly connected to UI state updates

### **Issue #2: Network Connectivity Failures**
**Current State:** API calls consistently fail with network errors
- Button interactions trigger failed HTTP requests
- Data persistence appears broken
- Real-time updates non-functional

**Business Impact:**
- Demo appears unreliable under pressure
- Technical credibility questioned
- Cannot demonstrate system robustness

**Root Cause:** API endpoint routing issues or CORS configuration problems

### **Issue #3: Static Data Presentation**
**Current State:** Dashboard shows identical data regardless of parameters
- Seed changes produce no visual differences
- Heat number variations show same content
- Reset controls appear cosmetic only

**Business Impact:**
- Cannot demonstrate system flexibility
- Fails to show adaptation to different scenarios
- Executives see no evidence of AI intelligence

**Root Cause:** Frontend not properly consuming dynamic backend data

### **Issue #4: Identical User Personas**
**Current State:** Role-based views show identical content
- Metallurgist and Operator dashboards are indistinguishable
- Manager and CFO views display same information
- Persona switching provides no value

**Business Impact:**
- Cannot demonstrate role-based value proposition
- Fails to address specific stakeholder needs
- Misses opportunity to show organizational alignment

**Root Cause:** Persona logic not implemented in UI components

### **Issue #5: Unclear Value Demonstration**
**Current State:** Demo fails to articulate business value of I-MELT
- No clear ROI demonstration
- Missing before/after scenarios
- Lacks compelling use case narratives

**Business Impact:**
- Executives cannot justify investment
- Sales cycles extended due to unclear value prop
- Competition gains advantage with clearer messaging

**Root Cause:** Product positioning not translated into demo experience
